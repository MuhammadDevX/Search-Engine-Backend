particular thats goldmine editing tip kind writing recently collected top takeaway chapter arranged editing checklist work blog post essay short story ive found tip incredibly helpful today wanted share seven powerful editing tip help breathe life writing turn plodding sentence paragraph fastpaced narrative capture attention reader let dive get moving introduction hart emphasizes importance getting moving right block make sure opening paragraph arent dry filled exposition instead include sentence two catch reader interest entices read hook reader action curiosity intrigue hook might first sentence piece real attention grabber like opening line george orwell bright cold day april clock striking thirteen recent memoir essay expecting unexpected new york city followed approach opening sentence twoandahalf year went college new york city witnessed crime however also bury hook several paragraph piece essay hidden treasure beneath library joan didion essay dreamer golden dream writes three paragraph imagine banyan street first banyan happened even hook appears several paragraph story essay make sure preceding paragraph fast moving might even hint twist something else unexpected coming lead tip push scene forward continuous motion scene stagnant end scene action move forward character shouldnt glued chair talking like robot bore reader tear scene dialogue include description character theyre talking often effective revealing theyre feeling used word like angrily example compare two sentence im talking said angrily im talking said slammed door behind youre editing piece look see youve included motion push scene forward youre writing informative blog post might mean including story illustrate point use language action action scene powerful could hart point powerful action word describe causality example let say youre describing woman driving car try swerve way something road could write car jerked left hart suggests would gripping write jerked wheel left put u closer action happening write active voice tip mind edit piece make sure youve written sentence active voice passive high school grammar little rusty read quick review passive sentence essentially passive sentence subject receives action rather performing example politician business executive like use passive voice want avoid claiming responsibility mistake might write mistake made neat little trick sentence avoids taking responsibility failing tell u made mistake note cant fix passive sentence tacking subject onto end mistake made u still passive fix write made mistake sentence active eliminate unnecessary word book writing well william zinsser note secret good writing strip every sentence cleanest component every word serf function every long word could short word every adverb carry meaning thats already verb every passive construction leaf reader unsure whatthese thousand one adulterant weaken strength sentence hart agrees recommends eliminating following unnecessary word order write strong sentence progressive tense auxiliary verb write wind blow wind blew instead wind blowing wind blown empty word example eliminate shared empty word article beginning action example dont say began race around room write raced around room use time marker straight chronology sometimes youre writing narrative necessary skip forward backward time however sure use clear time marker reader dont get confused reader stop try figure something happening definitely slow pace narrative time marker mean write line explaining next scene going take place example none would happened hadnt received call two day earlier fast forward three week later hart point sometimes time marker subtle might simply note fall color tree open new scene jump ahead summer autumn could slip height sun sky character walk building also belief straight chronology easiest reader follow evaluate piece see flashback really necessary sometimes ill rearrange paragraph piece realize jumping backward forward time might confusing reader speed slow speed boring part slow climatic scene speed wherever lot exposition make sure youre communicating whats absolutely necessary reader know ill ask paragraph description necessary backstory necessary reach climatic moment piece however youll want slow pace writing keep reader suspense give writing breathless quality hart quote pulitzerprize winner tom french reason slow reader really feel process really enter sceneand slow downyou allow space page allow sentence literally write shorter sentence get paragraph break use space find pause inside scene occur naturally would normally skip wrote varying sentence structure article takeaway seven editing tip simple straightforward start using right away make writing engaging fastpaced following tip youll better hold attention reader thus effective sharing message world youre looking strengthen writing storytelling skill definitely recommend getting copy hart book indepth read lot
